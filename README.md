***Swiss Pairings Tournament***

Running this is very simple (ignore the 'extra' folder - it is the extra credit I'm working on, but I wanted to submit my working version for the basic requirements first).

First, run `\i tournament.sql` to create the database and tables from the SQL file.

Next, run `python tournament_test.py` to run the basic test suite. And the code should pass all the tests. 

And you're done!
